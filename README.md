# 42-libft

The first project of the core curriculum of 42 Berlin. A static library of common C functions. At school we have a linting program called norminette limitint the lenght of the functions to 25 lines and dictating what we can do and not do. For example we are not allowed to use for loops, but while loops and we are not allowed to define variables in one line.



## What I learned then
- Don't mess around with pointers.
- The standard library has its own bugs.  Recreating the original functions exposes their sometimes unexpected weird behaviour.
- It is a good learning opportunity to get acquanited with the C language.

## What I know now
use of the keywords constant.  Inline keywords macros


## Example with the evolution of strlen
